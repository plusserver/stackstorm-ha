  # Custom pack configs and image settings.
  #
  # By default, system packs are available. However, since 'st2 pack install' cannot be run in the k8s cluster,
  # you will need to bake additional packs into an 'st2packs' image. Please see github.com/stackstorm/stackstorm-ha/README.md
  # for details on how to build this image.
  packs:
    # Custom StackStorm pack configs. Each record creates a file in '/opt/stackstorm/configs/'

    configs:
      core.yaml: |
        ---
        # example core pack config yaml

    # Custom packs images settings.
    # For each given st2packs container you can define repository, name, tag and pullPolicy for this image below.
    # Multiple pack images can help when dealing with frequent updates by only rebuilding smaller images for desired packs
    # E.g. having all desired StackStorm-Exchange packs in one image and several custom packs in additional images
    images:
      #- repository: index.docker.io/stackstorm
      #  name: st2packs
      #  tag: example
      #  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
      # Optional name of the imagePullSecret if your custom packs image is hosted by a private Docker registry behind the auth
      #  pullSecret: st2packs-auth

    # By default, pack containers provide data directly to each component on creation.
    # This causes a downtime, if you change pack containers, as the components will be recreated.
    # If you prefer availability, you can enable persistent volumes below.
    # This way, pack container contents will be shared between all components and updates do not lead to components recreation.
    # For this to work, you need an underlying storage that supports ReadWriteMany (see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#access-modes)
    #persistentVolumes:
    #  packs:
    #    resources:

    # If your kubernetes cluster does not have a default storageClass set, you can provide a specific one here
    # It has to support ReadWriteMany (see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#access-modes)
